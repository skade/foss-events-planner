# Description

Accessibility is a broad term and means designing your conference around disability needs. It's an important part of inclusion.

It is frequently missed at IT conferences, despite being an easy thing to set up.

The most important thing is that it needs to be set up _in the very beginning_.

## Categorisation

Type: Accessibility
Implementation difficulty: easy

## Why?

Not designing an accessible event is a frequent form of _exclusion_.

Documentation is important
